# CRT-Royale ReShade Presets

Presets ported from [libretro/slang-shaders](https://github.com/libretro/slang-shaders) for the [ReShade port of CRT-Royale](https://github.com/akgunter/crt-royale-reshade), so make sure you have that before installing those.
Installing those presets are as simple as installing others. It uses the LUT shader for the LUT textures (which are included), and CRT-Royale itself.

Currently includes
- Kurozumi preset
- XM29_Plus preset

Let me know if you want any other presets ported for it. The shader has gotten surprisingly refined and close to RetroArch, however, results may still not be 1:1. I did my best for it to look OK though.
